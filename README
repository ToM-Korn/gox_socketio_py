Complete working python socket.io code for mtgox.
Just download, and run activate_gox_stream.py
Notice the fails, its on the mtgox server side. Still in beta.

Both the websocket and socketio libraries were borrowed from,
https://github.com/molecular/traidor

Molecular in turn got the websocket code from,
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/websocket-client/0.4
